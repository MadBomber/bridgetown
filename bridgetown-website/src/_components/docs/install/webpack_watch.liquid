To get the latest frontend code whenever you refresh your browser, you'll want to
run `yarn dev`. But how do you run that _and_ Bridgetown? **Answer:** open a second
terminal window! Then you can run `yarn dev` in one and `bundle exec bridgetown
serve` in the other.

An even easier approach (but it requires a bit of setup first) is to create a
Procfile and use [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) to run both
services at once. Now we're really getting our geek on!
