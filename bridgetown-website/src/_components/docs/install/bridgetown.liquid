## Install Bridgetown

Now all that is left is to install Bridgetown!

```sh
gem install bridgetown -N
```

Now, try to create a new Bridgetown site at `./mysite`:

```sh
bridgetown new mysite
cd mysite
```

Install additional Bridgetown gems and frontend dependencies:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
```

Now you should be able to build the site and make it available on a local server:

```sh
$ yarn build && bundle exec bridgetown serve
```

Try opening the site up in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000){:target="_blank"}. See something? Awesome, you're ready to roll! If not, try revisiting your installation and setup steps, and if all else fails, [reach out to the Bridgetown community for support](/docs/community/).
